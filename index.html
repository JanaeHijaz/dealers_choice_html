         <h1> Contemporary Art: Key Concepts Through Time</h1>
            This is a brief collection of writings that I have done over the years, analyzing a number of famous artworks in various forms. These pieces of analysis touch on key concepts of contemporary art, and guide the reader through a thorough and intentional viewing of each piece and the artist's impact in relation to its historical and artistic context.

    <p>I have loved Lam's works for many years because he very intimately depicts the complexities of African culture and influence within the Americas (specifically Cuba) which taps into my own larger creative and anthropological interests. His work has always been admired yet hard to define and categorize, as he plays between modernism/surrealist influence, and Afro-Cuban elements - taking inspiration and technique from the likes of Pablo Picasso (a friend and collaborator), while remaining deeply connected to and influenced by his African spiritual traditions such as Santeria. </p>
    <p> Looking at his most famous work, my eyes dance over what seems to be a dense forest of thick vegetation and sugarcane. What initially appeared to be sugarcane suddenly looks like human limbs and exaggerated and eroticized breasts and buttocks, human limbs morph into animal parts, faces become masks peaking out from within the dense forest. Lam's work employs a striking level of synthesis, as these hybridized human/animal/vegetal figures become simplified and reduced to their most essential elements, yet almost interchangeable. Proportionality is irrelevant, and what the eye captures is up for debate. (Note: The Jungle is often compared to the Guernica and it is clear to see why). </p>
    <p> I revisit this painting after having wondered for so long where this artist "fit" in the chronology. While Lam was influenced by many notable Surrealist and Cubist artists which is evident in his work, it was not because of a need or involuntary pull to follow a linear idea of artistic progress (which chronology suggests), but rather a utilization of the style and aesthetic that best articulated his message.  What I see now is that through Surrealist aesthetics, Lam was able to challenge the idea of modern and Western art, bringing forth representations of Afro-Cuban culture and religion which were largely viewed as primitive and outside of the bounds of modern art and merely used for "inspirational" purposes (à la Picasso).  Another aspect to note is that a key component of Afro-Cuban religion is Syncretism. During the times of slavery in Latin America, traditional African religions were forbidden and Catholicism was forced upon enslaved Africans. In response to this, African  traditions became blended and intermingled with Catholic practices as a way to keep them hidden, yet alive. Lam practices his own version of syncretism through representation. Surrealism allows him to use symbolism and iconography to entertain the subconscious mind, and lying beneath the imagery, one finds a deeper, richer nod to African cultures and religion. As he said himself, "Surrealism merely gave me an opening..." </p>

    <p>Nick Cave's Soundsuits really taps into this process and theme of covering to re-define and repurpose. These works are a perfect example of the incongruous materiality that defines modern and contemporary art. What would have probably been viewed as ugly, annoying, or distasteful in classical times (similar to Degas), is viewed as a completely sensory experience in which each aspect of the suit, as well as the way that we experience it, is part of its beauty and intention. Additionally, Cave undergoes a thorough process of seeking out and collecting his materials. Cave has explained in many of his interviews that he doesn't often know what the suit will look like as he's collecting materials, and he also doesn't know where each particle will go on the "body" until it is happening. This, to me, speaks to the arbitrary and serendipitous process that an artist undergoes when creating maximum space for materiality. </p>

    <p>The concept of Soundsuits came as a result of Cave's reckoning with the Rodney King beatings and subsequent social unrest of the 90s. It was his way of redefining human identity using materiality to confront how we view and characterize the human body based on appearance. What if we were to use other materials, twigs, fur, beads, glass, glitter, metal scraps...to reframe this body and force the viewer to see something new? This new covering acts as a kind of armor and asks us to rethink what we know of this human form. Materiality is in conversation with us through this process.</p>

    <h4><a id='jacoblawrence'>Jacob Lawrence - "The Migration Series"</a></h4>

    </div>
    <p>In The Migration Series, Jacob Lawrence narrates (both visually, and through the titles of each panel), the epic tale of mass exodus of African Americans from the Southern states to the North during the early 20th century. </p>
    <p>Lawrence’s Panel No. 1 depicts a large crowd of people shuffling around each other trying to enter into one of 3 doors: Chicago, New York, or St. Louis, denoting the goal of relocation to one of these cities in search of better opportunities. The shapes and color palette are simple and uniform throughout, and Lawrence exemplifies synthetic representation by focusing on a sea of coats, buttons, hats, and hands gripping luggage handles. We see no facial features or expressions, and there is very little emotion on display. Each body merges into the other, leaving only a mass of summarized and simplified shapes to create the image. I compare this synthetic nature to that of impressionist paintings in the 1870s, who wished not to capture every single detail of a scene held in place, but rather the speed and dynamism of everyday life. Lawrence does something similar, as the slightly backward swayed placement of the coats and the forward leaning stance of each figure suggests swift movement. It creates an impression of rushing, and a sense of urgency that is completely in step with the nature of the historical moment that is being narrated.</p>
    <p>Looking at Lawrence’s choice of color, there is a very simple and uniform color palette: black, brown, red, yellow, green and blue. The colors are deep and rich, and while each face and hand is brown, the rest are placed throughout to create variety and distinguish each figure from the next. An interesting fact here is that when creating these works, Lawrence used one color at a time and filled in each shape with that color across each of the 60 panels, before moving to another color and doing the same - lining up each board and filling them all in at once. Each piece is tied to the others through this continuity of color, and each human figure is therefore tied to everyone else. This, in my opinion, only further adds to the cohesion and sense of community that is depicted within this series/story. There are no individuals; only a mass, a sea of beings moving together as one.</p>
    <p>I feel that Lawrence used synthesis here in order to tell our eyes what is important and what is not. I think of the synthetic representation of Medieval times that we have explored in our lectures, and just as they minimized detail in order to easily tell a story, so does Lawrence. One can quickly and easily move their eyes across the panels and understand the movement, fleeing, urgency and dynamism that is taking place. The figures are transitory, and one can see that there is a point of departure and will be a point of arrival.</p>
    <p>But what if the artist had chosen optical realism or abstraction? A more abstract version of this series would completely take away from the movement and intentional environment that has been created by these human forms. Keeping in mind that these works were created in the height of the Harlem Renaissance, he is in line with an artistic tradition in which Black figures are painted in community with one another in order to depict their everyday lives and experiences. Abstraction would completely dissolve the humanity which lies at the core of these works. </p>
    <p>In the case of optical realism, I think that we would have enjoyed extremely detailed and life-like faces, perhaps more variety of color and body shape, and certainly a stronger emotional pull. However, what would have been lost in that accuracy is the ongoing story that requires one to zoom out. The viewer would be able to spend hours looking at one individual piece, taking in all of the details, rather than moving from one panel to another. Lawrence uses synthetic realism to encourage us to keep moving. </p>

    <h4><a id='zapatista'>Diego Rivera - "Zapatista Landscape"</a></h4>

    <p>Internationally known as a prominent Mexican muralist, Diego Rivera, like many of his contemporaries, had his own period of indulging in the newness of European styles of representation. His early style of works, a combination of portraits and Mexican landscapes, quickly pivoted when he had the opportunity to live and study in France for a number of years. It was during this time, between 19011 and 1920, that Rivera took inspiration from the likes of Picasso, Braque, and Juan Gris and began experimenting with Cubism. </p>

    <p>Zapatista Landscape, shown above, is understandably his most famous Cubist work. Here, he dives fully into the key components of the Cubist aesthetic - the deconstruction of the subject matter, overlapping geometric planes, and an abstract perspective. Taking a moment to look more deeply at this piece, I see that Rivera has incorporated a variety of colors, textures, and symbols. I would divide this piece into 2 parts: the foreground, which appears as a tight cluster of geometric clues, and the background, which adds nature and landscape. The foreground is assembled as a floating object in the middle of the painting. I find a number of components, such as a sombrero, a serape (the patterned cloth worn as a shawl in many Latin American countries), a rifle, and a wooden box - direct references to Mexican culture and life. The colors are bright and intoxicating, creating texture and pulling the foreground even further from the landscape behind it. It’s as if Rivera has attached one painting on top of another. </p>

    <p>In the background, we see lush green leaves, and grey volcano tops in the distance. However, I also see something more - the combination of these 2 parts complicates how I characterize this painting in terms of representation. While he does use Cubism to convey abstraction, he walks a thin line between the abstract and reality. Perhaps the most interesting part of the image is far off into the corner: a small, life-like piece of paper, painted with detail and accuracy, nailed to the wall. One can also see what appears to be a single eye - situated beneath the geometric forms of a hat - teasing us with a touch of humanity in the midst of abstraction. This is a cubist reimagining of Emiliano Zapata, Mexican revolutionary figure of that time, and he has been presented to us almost in hiding, peeking out from behind a busy pile of shapes.  It seems to me that despite his use of Cubism at that moment in time, he could not help but leave a clue for the viewer about his deeper motivations and where his art would soon go. While Cubism isn’t known for expressing emotion or mood, he manages to do this somehow, which moves the polarities of representation closer together on the canvas.  He played with abstraction in this sense, indulging in the aesthetics of European modernism while bringing his cultural and political sensibilities along and hiding them in plain sight. It’s as if Rivera “breaks the 4th wall” of his Cubist performance - trying his best to mimic that of his European contemporaries, but offering us these tiny life-like elements as a gift.</p>

    <p>Why abstraction then? I would argue that Rivera had a strong desire to expand his artistic abilities, and the opportunity for him to travel to and study in Paris, at the height of this Cubist movement, excited him. What came of these few years of painting in Paris were a reflection of the time and place, and suggested a desire to create art for art’s sake. He not only had the ability to use optical realism or synthesis instead in this case, but that would’ve been his standard form of practice. He could have, at any time, portrayed Emilio Zapata with a more realistic approach (and he does in later years, quite often!). And of course, it would've been detailed, accurate, and a reflection of reality. But why not play with something new?  I posit that these works took place during a brief pause and period of experimentation in line with the movements of that era. As many European artists have done with “primitive” styles of art making, Rivera used the Cubist movement as a source of inspiration - pushing him in a new direction artistically, and giving him a brief moment of escape from what was waiting for him at home. However, Rivera soon became anxious to return to his home country, which was in the throws of a political revolution. He returned to Mexico in 1920 with a new purpose and from there we see an intentional transition from abstraction to back to optical realism.</p>

    <h4><a id='rich'>Diego Rivera - "Night of the Rich"</a></h4>
    <div>
        <a href='https://www.diego-rivera.net/night-of-the-rich/'> Read More </a> 
    </div>
    <p>I have selected Diego Rivera’s Night of the Rich as an exploration of optical realism. This is such a drastic shift from his times of experimenting with Cubism in the 1910s that I discussed previously, and I believe that the use of optical realism here is crucial to the meaning behind the work, as well as the purpose that his art served during this time. </p>

    <p>Rivera has the ability to condense and summarize historical and cultural themes without sacrificing their meaning or the emotional and intellectual impact that they make. It has been discussed many times that synthesis seeks to condense and summarize, however, this is something different. He does not reduce any of the details or accuracy of the figures, but rather, he fully utilizes optical realism while reducing an entire history to a single scene. Similar to classical Renaissance paintings (a source of inspiration of course), Rivera puts every body, every character, to good use within the painting. Every facial feature and emotion, the positioning of the bodies, what they wear, how they interact with one another. Everything matters and has been intentionally placed for the viewer to devour both visually and intellectually. </p>

    <p>Looking at Night of the Rich, it’s clear that, once again, there is a foreground and a background that are in intense conversation with one another. Closer to the viewer, we see a lavish party being enjoyed by the wealthy Mexican elite. Rivera wastes no space in this scene, showing us a variety of characters and using every detail of their appearance to clearly communicate who they are. The men are dressed in expensive suits and hats, holding cigars and bags of money. The women sip martinis and are adorned with jewelry. The gentleman in the bottom right corner has become too intoxicated and passes out. Wealthy men behind him look mischievous as they plot and scheme on ways to remain rich. They look free and without a care in the world - indoors and protected from the harsh elements outside. Even further, they all have fairer skin. </p>

    <p>These characters also seem to be completely lost in the moment enjoying themselves. They barely look at one another and certainly not outside. They seem completely oblivious to what lingers behind them. On the banner hanging above their heads: “Todos los pesos duros” (all the hard money), is a reference to the hard work of the lower class, and the gains that are made as a result that are hoarded by the wealthy for their enjoyment. </p>

    <p> However, in the background of this Night of the Rich, an entirely different mood and emotion is at play. Rivera employs a number of strategies to show this contract. Firstly, the scene from outside of the window is much darker, conveying a somber mood. He includes elements of nature (trees and the sun setting behind them) in contrast to the lush pillow that a wealthy woman rests upon. The men are of lower class, most likely farmers judging by their dirty clothes and overalls. They wear no jewelry, only rifles and fully stocked bandoliers. They have darker skin, suggestive of the fact that they are laborers and work in the sun. While their faces are less detailed and shadowed, one cannot avoid their expressions of anger and seriousness. Huddled together and looking at one another, they plan their attack on the Rich. Indeed, they are having a different kind of night. </p>

    <p>Rivera utilizes optical realism fantastically here. He spares no details, and that is intentional. From looking over this painting, I see the juxtaposition of lifestyle, perspective, and human experience. One can grasp the seemingly self-centered attitudes of the wealthy, in comparison to the focus, sorrow, and sense of urgency in the background. Rivera very accurately presents the unfolding of revolutionary thought and action - the uprising of the working class, the development of their Marxist and anti-Capitalist sensibilities, and the dichotomy between them and the Mexican elite, who will soon be removed from the power and status that they enjoyed.</p> 

    <p>Upon returning to Mexico in the early 1920s, it is said that Rivera felt a level of rejuvenation and excitement surrounding the state of his country and where it was headed. Having had the opportunity to also study in Italy, Rivera became enamoured with frescos, a style of mural making in which pigment is applied onto a thin, wet layer of plaster. This method is central to paintings of the Italian Renaissance, and once adopted by Rivera, became central to the mural movement in Mexico City. During this era, Rivera was commissioned by the new government to create a multitude of murals around the country, depicting the history of Mexico, its independence, its cultures, and revolutionary uprising. These monstrous works were meant to educate, inspire, and remind the populous of their history and those who impacted it. This was accomplished with intentionality, accuracy, details, and emotion. Abstraction, and even synthesis, would have simply been insufficient in this case. In contrast to Medieval use of synthesis in order to tell a (biblical) story, Rivera tapped into important historical events to create a full narrative. To synthesize and reduce these components visually, or present an inaccurate depiction of reality as it was, would not have ignited and maintained the fire that it did then and continues to do today.</p>

    </div>
    <p>Salman Toor is a Pakistani-American contemporary artist based in New York City (a favorite of mine) whose works focus on new masculinities, queerness, and the intersections and complexities of sexuality and culture. I will focus on his works, Eleventh Street (2018).</p>
    <p>Looking at this painting of men, I see that Toor, a queer man, is pulling in both his sexuality and his Pakistani heritage. While a male dominated painting, Toor has depicted these men partaking in sensitive, gentle, and affectionate behaviors. In the foreground, a young Pakistani man moves gracefully on the street while gazing into the eyes of another man who has kneeled down to pet his dog. They lock eyes and smile at one another in this tender moment, while the dog proceeds to lick the kneeling man’s face. Across the street, 2 men walk together closely, looking back at an older gentleman selling books. And in the back corner, we see a few men sitting in what could be a mosque, praying together. It is not just what they are doing that questions masculinity, but also the positioning of their bodies. They appear light on their feet, whimsical, and at a slow pace. This stands in opposition to conventional depictions of men who are firm, upright, and quick moving. Their bodies are close to each other, and they appear in love or emotionally close to one another as well.</p>
    <p>Here, Toor plays with acceptable views of both cultural identity and sexuality. It is intentional that the majority of the men in this depiction are also Brown like him. Pakistani culture, like many other Middle Eastern and Asian cultures, is known to be very religious and conversative, primarily Muslim in practice. With little tolerance of homosexuality, Toor draws focus to the necessity of oscillating between being Brown and being Queer, andthe ways in which he exists on the outskirts of both due to their intersectionality.  He imagines a world in which he can openly be both, disrupting strongly held cultural considerations about sexuality. Traditional notions of masculinity are even more pronounced and abided by in this case. Eleventh Street not only challenges culturally rooted ideas of masculinity, but also magnifies the safety and security of queer communities and relationships, usually only acted upon in private.</p>

    <p> Hunt painted this scene in an effort of moralizing women, hinted at in the title itself. The representation of the mistress in this image depicts a moment in which a misguided and impure mistress awakens to the reality of her status and morality (or lack there-of). Her positionality, looking out into a garden and alluding to the Garden of Eden (and the original sin), represents, perhaps, her new found awareness of her guiltiness. Hunt evokes feelings of guilt, and also presents the possibility of redemption and repentance as a path to the rebirth of the virtuous, socially acceptable woman.</p>
    <p> Hunt delineates the representation of the guilty party (mistress) and innocent party (married man) very intentionally. The male character is portrayed with a soft, gentle, friendly, and childlike face. His helplessness, and therefore implied innocence is suggested here. He appears flustered, with rosy red cheeks, reclining comfortably in his chair with her weight on him. What I find interesting is that the mistress, in her moment of awakening, is also portrayed with a level of softness. Despite her societal role, she remains clothed from floor to neck. Her face is also relaxed and innocent, searching for something more. While there is some hint of her shape, she is largely shielded from the historical tendency to focus on the naked female body. It’s as if she is already forgiven, by Hunt, for her transgressions. 
    </p>
    <p> Yet even still, the narrative here is that she, simply by nature of being a woman, is the temptress, and therefore responsible for the scene and relationship taking place here. It is expected and anticipated that a married man will have a mistress, therefore, this is just the way things are. It is not his fault, nor responsibility to repent or seek awakening. There is an undertone of Christian values and biblical narratives as social mores, which keep women, regardless of status, under a microscope of morality in which they are always guilty because of their sex/uality.

        In Dalí’s famous surrealist painting, we see, again, the dichotomy of male and female within the context of sexuality, and how guilt and innocence are also reinforced. Here we see what can only be described as a monster in female form. Headless, gigantic, decaying, yet very clearly sexualized as female. The breasts are exaggerated, as well as a clearly female body shape with long muscular legs. The female monster is terrifying to look at, yet it is of utmost importance, it would appear, that her sex be highlighted. Dalí, like many surrealist painters of that time, veered toward depicting women as both objects of desire as well as terror. In comparison to the soft, docile, yet sexual mistress in Awakening Conscience, Dalí takes the Madonna-Whore complex in the opposite direction - by depicting the female monster as aggressive, scary, and overpowering. We can see this emphasized by the juxtaposition of the small boy in the right hand corner, small in stature, holding a whip with which to tame her. Very David and Goliath-esque, in my opinion. Again, the male figure is represented as child-like, innocent, and helpless in the face of mischievous female sexuality that must be controlled.

    <p>I hold the works of Gordon Parks very dearly in my heart because of what he was able to do with a camera, but also what his creative eye was able to achieve in a larger cultural context. Parks' dedicated much of his adult life to capturing the intricacies and daily experiences of Southern Black American life. The photograph above depicts an empty classroom that somehow manages to speak so clearly to a certain cultural and human experience despite the fact that there are no people present. We see a room,  made ceiling-walls-and floors of wooden boards, that is used as a classroom for Black students. Taken in 1956, Parks captured the reality of racial segregation in the South, during which time limited and unequal resources informed Black American (our) quality of life. The desks are scattered around the room, in that old style in which the desk is connected to the back of the chair in front of it. Off in the corner there is a large heater for use during the winter. The air of the room is dusty and old, yet the ambience feels calm and quiet at the same time. It could be a ghost town, but it is not. The photo appears to be taken slightly from above, as our eyes follow the length of the wooden ceiling which also pulls our gaze down into the center of the room. Most likely, this small classroom is a one-room school in the back of a church, as was typical of this time period. My grandparents, who are Black American, went to a school that looked like this. As did my great-grandparents.</p>
    <p>Despite the undercurrent of inequality, Parks captures our experience with such care. His photographs feel warm, and full of respect, admiration, fascination, and love. He finds the beauty in plain things and brings a level of worthiness to an everyday occurrence. At times I feel that photography can contain a level of voyeurism or exploitation, depending on who is behind the camera and who is in front of it. I gravitate toward this photo, and many others of his, because there is an element of vulnerability that comes with safety and proximity to the subject(s). He was able to bring such intimate moments and spaces into the larger American narrative, while allowing me to continue to see myself even though I am not there.</p>

    <p>I've realized that I find the majority of Kara Walker’s art to be ugly. I think that Walker is a talented artist, and would definitely fall under the umbrella of political-critical/difficult/dependent beauty. Given the themes of her work, which are primarily historical and emotional portrayals of sex, gender, race, and colonialism, she fulfills the function that Asavei references. For that reason, yes, the work could be considered beautiful. This particular work portrays incredibly grotesque and violent scenarios, that are not without context. Walker brings the atrocities and inhumane nature of US history to the forefront through a series of visual vignettes. The simple black and white palette creates a sense of mystery, in which the acts themselves appear hidden in the shadows, but Walker emphasizes the sharpness of knives and swords, and broken tree trunks and branches. Each scene is separate on it’s own small island of land, but together, speak to a larger connected pattern of historical behavior. The characters at play reenact heinous acts of sexual violence and assault that are embedded in a violent history of slavery, and it is undoubtedly difficult and uncomfortable to take in as a viewer. I find the painting “ugly” because it fulfills its intended function - to make the viewer think, reflect, and face that discomfort. I don’t find the artwork itself aesthetically pleasing, and the intense nature of the imagery almost prevents me from assessing the aesthetics of the work in a vacuum.</p>
